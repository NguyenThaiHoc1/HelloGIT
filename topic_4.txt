As we know. In VietNam more and more students violating traffic law and 
I have a few solutions solve for this problem
First, we should punish very seriously. for instance when students violating traffic law
we should send mail to university where they study and The University will give some penalty for that students.
Besides, Sending mail to family these students

Second, we need open classes about traffic law at university where students are studying
For example, nowaday at university have very litter courses about traffic law. so we should 
open courses about it.Bring traffic education to become subject at university

Finally, In VietNam we have sentence "Study goes as a pair with pratice".
we should open competitions about traffic law. which we studied at university

In conclution with many solutions i presented above. I hope it will solve that issue

Tại sao thực phẩm bẩn vẫn còn tồn tại 
Thứ nhất: Thiếu trách nhiệm trong các khâu kiểm tra chất lượng trước khi đến tay người tiêu dùng
Thứ hai: Giá thành của thực phẩm bẩn rẻ đánh vào tâm lý của những người bán vì bản thân 
Thứ ba: Tại Việt Nam Xử phạt về vấn đề vệ sinh an toàn thực phẩm còn nhẹ chưa đủ sức ranh đe

As we know, food issue is a hot issue in the world. In VietNam more and more cases of food safety violation have been reported in the media, causing serious concern* for consumers. Today I would like to show some reasons about why this problem still exists ? 

First, The lack of responsibility in checking the product before it are brought to users. For example, 
when all products from the world come to VietNam. 
Alway is checked by department manage about quality verify food, etc, ... If this food is not attend level 
safety, it will return to origin of productions 

Second, food of unknow origin is cheaper than food safety so some people want to earn a lot of money. 
For example a one kiligram beef is 70.000 VND for food safety. But food of unknow origin just only 40.000 VND. 
30.000 is very large and so this is one of main reasons 
that food of unknow origin still exists

Finally, the Government have not been handled for people who selling food safety violation. 
for Example, when selling the food safety violation. we will only be warned for local region or if it worse than, 
we just only pay fee for that

In conclusion with some reasons I presented above. I think these reason above is making food safety violantion still exists in VietNam 
and I hope for government have a few solution solve this problem soon

As we known, The multi-level marketing field is growing and lead to many 
companies has been built in around the world such: AmyWay, Avon, etc …  . 
In Vietnam this business model is very developing. Besides, In Vietnam this business model much changer than the business model origin
.Today I want to present some reasons that I think Government should ban this business model in VietNam 

First, This business model in VietNam can create bad habit for users who joining in this model. For Instance, I used to be invited 
to event talk show which presenting about "How to earn easy money ?" and they talk a lot of things "No works you still earn Money" is one of things. They commit that The people join in this model will earn billion money without having to do anything 

Second, The multi-level model is focused on quality of products But In VietNam, this problem is not overly concerned in here, so quality of products often very low. For Example, i used to buy a product of "Sen Viet" multi-level company, but it have quality lower than when they marketed

Finally, With increasing of the multi-level company, Government will be diffcult to manage these companies. 
For Example, today more and more multi-level companies is rising, Besise, The ghost companies appeared. 
"Sen Vang" is multi-level company which have take billion money of thousand people. 
But Now Government has been get back money for people who joining in this company 

In conclusion with some reasons that I presented above, i think Government should ban this business model quickly

Sencond, Developing knowledge of child about abuse behavior throught resources like: films, books and information, 
additional more course teach about it on school. For Instance, School need to provide more and more books about abuse behavior

Finally,  Help friends, neighbor or everyone around you. Becoming a parent is not easy, Sometime they will need to help from 
someone, giving some solutions for us education with us child. For instance, I have a boy who borned by my brother.
