As we known, The multi-level marketing field is growing and lead to many 
companies has been built in around the world such: AmyWay, Avon, etc …  . 
In Vietnam this business model is very developing. Besides, In Vietnam this business model has been changed from the business model origin.Today I want to present some reasons that I think Government should ban this business model in VietNam 

First, This business model in VietNam can create bad habit for users who joining in this model. For Instance, I used to be invited 
to event talk show which presenting about "How to earn easy money ?" and they talk a lot of things "No works you still earn Money" is one of things. They commit that The people join in this model will earn billion money without having to do anything 

Second, The multi-level model is focused on quality of products But In VietNam, this problem is not overly concerned in here, so quality of products often very low. For Example, i used to buy a product of "Sen Viet" multi-level company, but it have quality lower than when they marketed

Finally, With increasing of the multi-level company, Government will be diffcult to manage these companies. For Example, today more and more multi-level companies is rising, Besise, The ghost companies appeared. "Sen Vang" is multi-level company which have take billion money of thousand people. But Now Government has been get back money for people who joining in this company 

In conclusion with some reasons I presented above I think Government should ban this business model quickly
